# AI_Python_Project

The final project for the Udacity AI for Python Programming course

Here is the URL to my project on streamlit, if the app has gone to sleep and needs a reboot contact me and I'll reboot.

https://udacityaipythonproject-eks9egj8arnnwcukwmvbxt.streamlit.app/

The cat_to_name.json that the predictions come from was supplied for the assignment. I've added a folder of images that were tested that will show that it does in fact provide different predictions > Streamlit test images.

Here is the link for mybinder.org to view the code:
